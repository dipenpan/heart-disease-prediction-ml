# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts the risk of heart disease using multiple machine learning algorithms.  
It compares the performance of various classifiers and identifies the best model for predictions.

The models implemented include:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is `heart.csv` containing patient health records such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of ST Segment
- And other medical parameters

> **Note:** This dataset must be placed in the project root directory before running the script.
